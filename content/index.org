* Introduction

Welcome. Iâ€™m very excited you found this place. Here you can find things I want to share. For some of these things you might have to look around a bit. It might be worth it, though.

The best thing that can come out of this, is us working on giving a shared idea life.

I never check my social media and probably should delete my accounts. If you want to make the best thing happen, just [[mailto:felix@felixbuchholz.com][send me an email]].
